# Introduction

**clido** is an AI coding agent for your terminal. Give it a task in plain English and it will read your codebase, write code, run tests, fix errors, and report back — all inside a single conversation.

It is built in Rust and ships as a single statically-linked binary with no runtime dependencies.

## What clido does

clido connects a large language model to a set of tools that can interact with your filesystem and shell:

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `Bash` | Runs shell commands with timeout and sandboxing support |
| `Read` | Reads file contents with optional line-range slicing |
| `Write` | Creates or overwrites files |
| `Edit` | Applies precise string replacements to existing files |
| `Glob` | Finds files matching a pattern |
| `Grep` | Searches file content with regex |
| `SemanticSearch` | Searches your indexed repository by symbol or concept |

The agent loops autonomously — it calls tools, observes results, and continues until it completes the task, hits a turn limit, or exceeds a cost budget.

## Key capabilities

- **Interactive TUI** — a Ratatui-based terminal UI with a chat pane, real-time tool progress, permission prompts, and a cost/token status strip
- **Persistent sessions** — every conversation is stored as a JSONL file; resume any session with `--continue` or `--resume <id>`
- **Long-term memory** — facts extracted from sessions are stored in SQLite and injected into future conversations automatically
- **Repository index** — build a file and symbol index to enable fast semantic search across large codebases
- **Workflows** — declare multi-step agent pipelines in YAML with dynamic parameters and parallel steps
- **MCP servers** — connect external tools over the Model Context Protocol
- **Multiple providers** — Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible endpoints, OpenRouter, and local Ollama models
- **Audit log** — every tool call is logged with inputs, outputs, and timing for review

## Why clido

- **Provider-agnostic** — use any LLM provider (16+ supported) or local models via Ollama
- **Single binary** — no runtime, no package manager, one `curl` and you're running
- **Persistent sessions** — pick up where you left off, with full history and context
- **YAML workflows** — automate multi-step agent tasks declaratively
- **MCP support** — extend the agent with external tools via the Model Context Protocol
- **Built for CI/CD** — embed in pipelines and scripts with `--non-interactive` mode

## A first look

Start a session in the current directory:

```bash
$ clido "refactor the parse() function in src/parser.rs to return Result<T, ParseError>"
```

clido reads the file, plans the change, applies it with the Edit tool, runs `cargo check`, and summarises what changed:

```
[Turn 1] Reading src/parser.rs...
[Turn 2] Applying edit to src/parser.rs...
[Turn 3] Running cargo check...
[Turn 4] All checks pass. Refactor complete.

  Modified: src/parser.rs
  Cost: $0.0021  Turns: 4  Time: 8.3s
```

Or open the interactive TUI:

```bash
$ clido
```

```
