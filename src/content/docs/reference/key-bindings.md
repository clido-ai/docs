## Notes

- Key bindings are not currently user-configurable. Custom bindings are planned for a future release.
- `Ctrl+Y` and `/copy` rely on OSC 52 clipboard integration and may be blocked by some terminals or SSH hops.
- macOS Terminal.app has limited key support. iTerm2 or Warp are recommended for the best TUI experience.
